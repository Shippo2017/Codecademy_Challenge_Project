# Adopt a Pet

Imagine you are looking to add a new furry friend to your family! On the pet adoption website, you browse through the categories of animals and select the one you’re interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.

Every time you navigate to a different webpage, your browser is making a request to the web server. Thanks to routing, the server knows exactly which endpoint should handle the request and can return the correct HTML page to display.

In this project, you’ll use Python’s Flask framework to create a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.

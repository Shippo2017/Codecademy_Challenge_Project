# Explore the 1985 Cars Dataset
Have you ever wanted to have a collection of something? 
It could be trading cards, board games, art pieces, or whatever you want them to be. 
In this project, we’ll suppose you collect something with a lot of data - cars!

Your car collection is almost complete - it’s just missing one thing. You think about it for a while, then it comes to you - you don’t have a car from 1985! 
But there are so many cars from 1985 available for you to collect! 
How will you know which 1985 car you will buy for your collection?

Luckily for you, we have a dataset that stores precisely that information. This dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is linked here. This dataset has been adapted so that the variable names are along the first rows.

As you’ll notice in this project, though, this dataset isn’t ready for analysis yet. You will have to make some changes along the way to clean and tidy up the dataset. Do that, and you’ll have the ability to perform a great analysis!

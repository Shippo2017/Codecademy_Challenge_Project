# Citi Bike Data - Off Platform Project

Welcome to the off platform project focused on visualization. In this project, we will be exploring data associated with the New York City bike share program, Citi Bike! Remember, it may be easiest to read these instructions by clicking on the "Preview" button in RStudio.

There are over 850 Citi Bike stations in New York City &mdash; users check a bike out from a starting station and then dock that bike at a different station when they reach their destination. Citi Bike offers a variety of memberships, but most memberships allow for trips between 30 and 45 minutes &mdash; this will be relevant once we start digging into the dataset.

Citi Bike publically releases a variety of datasets. We've included a dataset containing information about individual trips from January of 2020. If you'd like to download a more recent dataset, or investigate other data that Citi Bike provides, take a look at their [System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) page. There are so many interesting questions that you can investigate with this data &mdash; we're about to walk you through a few, but we'd love to see what else you can discover!

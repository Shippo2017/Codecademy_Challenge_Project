# Museums and Nature Centers
There are thousands of museums, aquariums, and zoos across the United States. In this project, we’ll take a look at the distribution of these institutions by geographic region, type, and revenue.

Our data is compiled from administrative records from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, IRS records, and private foundation grantmaking records. This data reflects the status of each institution as of 2013. For each institution, we have information on its name, type, and location. Each institution also has a parent organization – for example, if a museum housed at a university, its parent organization is the university where it resides. Financial data on annual revenue is available at the parent organization level.

We’ll be creating several different data visualizations in this project. Some of these may feel challenging, but they’ll all relate back to the concepts we’ve learned in this lesson. If you get stuck on one plot, feel free to move on to a different section. We’ve provided hints throughout, and you can consult the lesson materials as well.

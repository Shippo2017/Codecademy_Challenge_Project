# Variance in Weather in R

You’re planning a trip to London and want to get a sense of the best time of the year to visit. Luckily, you got your hands on a dataset from 2015 that contains over 39,000 data points about weather conditions in London. Surely, with this much information, you can discover something useful about when to make your trip!

In this project, the data is stored in a DataFrame. If you’ve never used a DataFrame before, we’ll walk you through how to filter and manipulate this data. If you want to learn more about DataFrames, check out our R course.
